# Web Platform - Flask
Flask is a popular python framework for building web applications.
In this project, we support everything we have built so far with flask, allowing the connection between the static version of our AirBnB Clone, with the database. In the first 7 challenges, from 0 to 6, we explore the basics of flask, using some features to solvesimple challenges.
After then, we take a quick winding to improve our Database and Filestorage engines to support Flask.
From task 8 to 11, we start accessing data from our models and passing them to our Jinja templates.

All tasks have their numbers as prefixes to the filenames in this repo.
